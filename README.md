# This program is an auto theme changer for windows. 

He will take an average for each pixels of your webcam and if it's too dark for the program, he will change to dark.
Same to other side, if it's too light for the program, he will change to light.

The program doesn't record you.

If you want to create a .exe, do python -m PyInstaller --noconsole --onefile ChangeTheme.py

If you also want to check the code because of you don't have modules, click on install.bat.

If you want to use the program in the startup without click on it,
go in shell:startup with the combo windows + r (without + ) and put the Change Theme.exe into the folder.
